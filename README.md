<b> CODING JOURNEY</b> </br>
🌼My journey into frontend development began with a mix of excitement and challenge. As a beginner, I struggled with understanding the nuances of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, often feeling overwhelmed by the vast array of concepts and best practices. Debugging and fixing layout issues were particularly daunting, and I spent countless hours troubleshooting and experimenting with different solutions. Despite these hurdles, each small victory—whether it was making a responsive design work or creating an interactive feature—fueled my passion and determination.🤞</br>

<b>MY GOALS💟</b> </br>
My goal is to become a proficient full stack developer, combining my skills in both frontend and backend technologies to create impactful web applications. I aspire to work as a freelancer or in a healthy workplace environment where I can contribute to innovative projects and continue growing both personally and professionally.🦋</br>
